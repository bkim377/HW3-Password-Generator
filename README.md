# HW3-PasswordGenerator
1) Description: 
A password generator that creates a randomized password based on user-chosen criteria.  
Contains multiple prompts that let the user set the following parameters:
* Password length (8-128 characters)
* Whether the password uses (at least one should be used):
    * Uppercase letters
    * Lowercase letters
    * Numbers
    * Special characters (e.g. those listed at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters)

The page then generates a random password abiding by all of the user's selected criteria, either as an alert or as a part of the page.
